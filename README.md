1. Checking confidence level
- Since this is a classification problem, you can incorporate different labels or fields to your training data
- After the training process , processed to check the confindence level.
- The entire process is easily iterable on the platform, allowing for repeated iterations to improve the confindence level.

2. **Exporting your Model**
   
   - **Note** you can export your model in different formarts
   - - In this activity we will use p5.js 
     
4. **p5.js web interface**
Here is the code on p5.js web editor to get you started on the activitiy(remember to try using your model and see how it performs)

4. Next Steps 
- You can import your model into an Android App , google Colab etc. Explore more , don't limit yourself ! 

- Share the cool classification problems you have tried , leave a question or a comment as PR or issues to this repo
  
- Looking forward to the discusion!
